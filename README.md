        command I used
                        |
                        |

        bash etl.sh [redacted] [redacted] /home/shared/MOCK_MIX_v2.1.csv.bz2


Notes: if you don't hit Y on the prompt it will give and error becuase it can't overwite the source file. 
This was left in so I could repeatedly check the output of the report files
PS: Enjoy!
